## Features

- **Modular structure:** Each section (header, hero, highlight, etc.) is built as a separate component and organized into the `modules` folder.
- **Reusable components:** Created common components (button, input, heroCard, etc.) for reusability and consistency.
- **Responsive design:** Used [react-responsive](https://github.com/yocontra/react-responsive) to implement fully responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop following the Figma template.
- **Countdown clock:** Used [react-flip-clock-countdown](https://github.com/sLeeNguyen/react-flip-clock-countdown) for the animated countdown timer in the Highlight section.
- **SVG as component:** Learned to convert SVG files to React components for easier usage.
- **State management:** Used Zustand for simple, fast state management (like open/close mobile modal).
- **Project structure:** Learned and practiced organizing files and folders in a scalable React project.
- **Currently finished:** Only the homepage; more pages (Marketplace, NFT detail, Artist, Create Account) are planned.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for easy and quick deployment.
